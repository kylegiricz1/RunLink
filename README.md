# RunLink
RunLink is designed for runners to find workout partners! Users will be able to create a workout with a specified location, time, distance, and pace that other users can see and request to join.

# Goals
The goal of this project is to gain skills in full stack web development using the MERN stack and integrating other technologies such as redux, JWT, and the Google Maps API platform.
